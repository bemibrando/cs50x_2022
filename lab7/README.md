# Lab 7 - Songs

Write SQL queries to solve a mystery.

## Specification

For each of the following problems, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query, though you may nest other queries inside of your query. You should not assume anything about the `id`s of any particular songs or artists: your queries should be accurate even if the `id` of any particular song or person were different. Finally, each query should return only the data necessary to answer the question: if the problem only asks you to output the names of songs, for example, then your query should not also output each song’s tempo.

1. in `1.sql`, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in the database.
    - Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
2. in `2.sql`, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in increasing order of tempo.
    - Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
3. in `3.sql`, write a SQL query to list the names of the top 5 longest songs, in descending order of length.
    - Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
4. in `4.sql`, write a SQL query that lists the names of any songs that have danceability, energy, and valence greater than 0.75.
    - Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
5. in `5.sql`, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of all the songs.
    - Your query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the average energy.
6. in `6.sql`, write a SQL query that lists the names of songs that are by Post Malone.
    - Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
    - You should not make any assumptions about what Post Malone’s `artist_id` is.
7. in `7.sql`, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of songs that are by Drake.
    - Your query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the average energy.
    - You should not make any assumptions about what Drake’s `artist_id` is.
8. in `8.sql`, write a SQL query that lists the names of the songs that feature other artists.
    - Songs that feature other artists will include “feat.” in the name of the song.
    - Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
