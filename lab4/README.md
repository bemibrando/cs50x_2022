# Lab 4: Volume

Write a program to modify the volume of an audio file.
```
$ ./volume INPUT.wav OUTPUT.wav 2.0
```
Where `INPUT.wav` is the name of an original audio file and `OUTPUT.wav` is the name of an audio file with a volume that has been scaled by the given factor (e.g., 2.0).

## Implementations Details

Complete the implementation of `volume.c`, such that it changes the volume of a sound file by a given factor.

- The program accepts three command-line arguments: `input` represents the name of the original audio file, `output` represents the name of the new audio file that should be generated, and `factor` is the amount by which the volume of the original audio file should be scaled.
    - For example, if `factor` is `2.0`, then your program should double the volume of the audio file in `input` and save the newly generated audio file in `output`.
- Your program should first read the header from the input file and write the header to the output file. Recall that this header is always exactly 44 bytes long.
    - Note that `volume.c` already defines a variable for you called `HEADER_SIZE`, equal to the number of bytes in the header.
- Your program should then read the rest of the data from the WAV file, one 16-bit (2-byte) sample at a time. Your program should multiply each sample by the `factor` and write the new sample to the output file.
    - You may assume that the WAV file will use 16-bit signed values as samples. In practice, WAV files can have varying numbers of bits per sample, but we’ll assume 16-bit samples for this lab.
- Your program, if it uses `malloc`, must not leak any memory.
