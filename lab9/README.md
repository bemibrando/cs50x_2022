## Project Composition
Done:
- Add new person birthday.

Personal Touch:
- Edit person name or/and birthday.
- Delete a person.

## Specification

Complete the implementation of a web application to let users store and keep track of birthdays.

- When the `/` route is requested via `GET`, your web application should display, in a table, all of the people in your database along with their birthdays.
    - First, in `app.py`, add logic in your `GET` request handling to query the `birthdays.db` database for all birthdays. Pass all of that data to your `index.html` template.
    - Then, in `index.html`, add logic to render each birthday as a row in the table. Each row should have two columns: one column for the person’s name and another column for the person’s birthday.
- When the `/` route is requested via `POST`, your web application should add a new birthday to your database and then re-render the index page.
    - First, in `index.html`, add an HTML form. The form should let users type in a name, a birthday month, and a birthday day. Be sure the form submits to `/` (its “action”) with a method of `post`.
    - Then, in `app.py`, add logic in your `POST` request handling to `INSERT` a new row into the `birthdays` table based on the data supplied by the user.

Optionally, you may also:

- Add the ability to delete and/or edit birthday entries.
