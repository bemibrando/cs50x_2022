# Pset8 - Homepage

Build a simple homepage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Create a simple homepage that introduces yourself, your favorite hobby or extracurricular, or anything else of interest to you.

<p>To JavaScript challenge, I develop a drag and drog at `index.html`'s cards.</p>

## Specification

Implement in your `homepage` directory a website that must:

- Contain at least four different `.html` pages, at least one of which is `index.html` (the main page of your website), and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
- Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags besides `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<title>`. Using some tag (e.g., `<p>`) multiple times still counts as just one (1) of those ten!
- Integrate one or more features from Bootstrap into your site. Bootstrap is a popular library (that comes with lots of CSS classes and more) via which you can beautify your site. See <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap's documentation</a> to get started. In particular, you might find some of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/">Bootstrap's components'</a> of interest. To add Bootstrap to your site, it suffices to include
```
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC" crossorigin="anonymous">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-MrcW6ZMFYlzcLA8Nl+NtUVF0sA7MsXsP1UyJoMp4YLEuNSfAP+JcXn/tWtIaxVXM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
in your pages' `<head>`, below which you can also include
```
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
to link your own CSS.
- Have at least one stylesheet file of your own creation, `styles.css`, which uses at least five (5) different CSS selectors (e.g. tag (`example`), class (`.example`), or ID (`#example`)) and within which you use a total of at least five (5) different CSS properties, such as `font-size`, or `margin`; and
- Integrate one or more features of JavaScript into your site to make your site more interactive. For example, you can use JavaScript to add alerts, to have an effect at a recurring interval, or to add interactivity to buttons, dropdowns, or forms. Feel free to be creative!
- Ensure that your site looks nice on browsers both on mobile devices as well as laptops and desktops.
