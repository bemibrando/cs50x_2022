# Pset7 - Fiftyville

Write SQL queries to solve a mystery.

## Specification

For this problem, equally as important as solving the mystery itself is the process that you use to solve the mystery. In `log.sql`, keep a log of all SQL queries that you run on the database. Above each query, label each with a comment (in SQL, comments are any lines that begin with `--`) describing why you’re running the query and/or what information you’re hoping to get out of that particular query. You can use comments in the log file to add additional notes about your thought process as you solve the mystery: ultimately, this file should serve as evidence of the process you used to identify the thief!

As you write your queries, you may notice that some of them can become quite complex. To help keep your queries readable, see principles of good style at <a href="https://www.sqlstyle.guide/">sqlstyle.guide</a>. The <a href="https://www.sqlstyle.guide/#indentation">Identation</a> section may be particularly helpful!

Once you solve the mystery, complete each of the lines in `answers.txt` by filling in the name of the thief, the city that the thief escaped to, and the name of the thief’s accomplice who helped them escape town. (Be sure not to change any of the existing text in the file or to add any other lines to the file!)

Ultimately, you should submit both your `log.sql` and `answers.txt` files.
