# Pset 3: Plurality

For this program, you’ll implement a program that runs a plurality election, per the below.

```
$ ./plurality Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 4
Vote: Alice
Vote: Bob
Vote: Charlie
Vote: Alice
Alice
```

## Implementations Details

Complete the implementation of `plurality.c` in such a way that the program simulates a plurality vote election.

* Complete the `vote` function.
    * `vote` takes a single argument, a `string` called `name`, representing the name of the candidate who was voted for.
    * If `name` matches one of the names of the candidates in the election, then update that candidate’s vote total to account for the new vote. The `vote` function in this case should return `true` to indicate a successful ballot.
    * If `name` does not match the name of any of the candidates in the election, no vote totals should change, and the `vote` function should return `false` to indicate an invalid ballot.
    * You may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.
* Complete the `print_winner` function.
    * The function should print out the name of the candidate who received the most votes in the election, and then print a newline.
    * It is possible that the election could end in a tie if multiple candidates each have the maximum number of votes. In that case, you should output the names of each of the winning candidates, each on a separate line.

You should not modify anything else in `plurality.c` other than the implementations of the `vote` and `print_winner` functions (and the inclusion of additional header files, if you’d like).
